Dotfiles
======

This is my dotfiles folder. It's really just for me to keep handy - you can 
use it if you like. 

I originally forked from https://github.com/Integralist/ProVim but I've since
made a lot of customizations. This repo is designed for XFCE. 
I'm using Debian, but it will probably work on other linux systems too.

## Installation

To install, just make sure the `install.sh` file is executable 
(`chmod +x ./install.sh`)
then run it: `./install.sh`. It's pretty rough, so you'll definitely want
to read through the script before you execute. It'll wipe out existing files.
