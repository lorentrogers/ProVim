+] Intro

With Wildfire you can quickly select the closest text object among a group of candidates.
 By default candidates are "i'", 'i"', "i)", "i]", "i}", "ip" and "it".

+] Usage

Press <ENTER> in normal mode to select the closest text object. Keep pressing <ENTER> 
for selecting the next closest text object. To go the other way round, that is, to select the previously 
selected text object, press <BS>.

To speed things up, if you want to select the nth closest text object you can press a number followed 
by <ENTER> (e.g. pressing 2<ENTER> will select the second closest text object).
